I am a recent graduate from the Australian National University's research-focused flagship science undergraduate, the Bachelor of Philosophy (Science) Honours. I focused my coursework on mathematics and did my honours project in graph deep learning under [Associate Professor Qing Wang](https://comp.anu.edu.au/people/qing-wang/) of the [Graph Research Lab](https://graphlabanu.github.io/website/team/) and [Dr James Nichols](https://james-nichols.github.io/) of the [Biological Data Science Institute](https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/). I received First Class Honours. My thesis was titled "Augmenting Message Passing with Sheaves and Complexes".
