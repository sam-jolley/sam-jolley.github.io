I am a recent graduate from the Australian National University's research-focused flagship science honours degree, the Bachelor of Philosophy (Science). I focused my coursework on mathematics and did my honours project in graph deep learning under Associate Professor Qing Wang of the Graph Research Lab and Dr James Nichols of the Biological Data Science Institute.
