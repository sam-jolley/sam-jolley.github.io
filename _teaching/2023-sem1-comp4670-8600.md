I helped to teach the honours and graduate course [Statistical Machine Learning](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/COMP8600) by delivering tutorials, marking and giving feedback, and aiding in organising the operation of the course.

This course gives a broad and relatively deep introduction to statistical machine learning, inluding mathematical underpinnings and practical implementation.
