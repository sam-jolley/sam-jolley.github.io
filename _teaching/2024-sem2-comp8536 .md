I helped to teach the honours and graduate course [Advanced Topics in Deep Learning for Computer Vision](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/course/comp8536) by delivering labs, marking, giving feedback on research proposals, developing lab materials and autograding scripts, and aiding in organising the operation of the course.

This course covers deep learning from basic principles through to contemporary research in computer vision. Students undertake a group project contributing 70% of their final grade.
