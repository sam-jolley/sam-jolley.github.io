I helped to teach the first-year undergrade and masters course [Discrete Mathematical Models](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2023/course/MATH6005) by delivering tutorials, marking quizes and exams, and aiding in organising the operation of the course.

This course covers discrete mathematics with an eye towards applications, especially in computer science. Topics include elementary set theory, graph theory, and Markov chains.
