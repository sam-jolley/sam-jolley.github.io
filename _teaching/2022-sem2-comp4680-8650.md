I helped to teach the honours and graduate course [Advanced Topics in Machine Learning](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2022/course/COMP8650) by delivering tutorials, marking and giving feedback, and aiding in organising the operation of the course.

This course focused on convex optimisation and its role in machine learning and deep learning.
